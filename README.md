Hey there! 👋
I'm a passionate explorer in the world of code, constantly delving into the realms of Web Development, Algorithms, and Machine Learning.
From the intricacies of System Design and Operating Systems to the fascinating world of Networks, I'm always eager to learn and experiment. Currently, I'm sharpening my skills in React ⚛️ and Golang 🐹, while also taking on the challenge of building my own system design components! 🚀

I'm also a big fan of the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) 🌐 and absolutely love coding in JavaScript. 💻

Let's connect, collaborate, and code something amazing together! 💡
